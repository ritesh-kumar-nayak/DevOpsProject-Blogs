# Welcome Note:

Hey guys , here I am again with some of the \*\*Linux \*\*stuffs that I have just started learning as I have kick-started my journey with **DevOps** . As a DevOps Engineer Linux is a very basic requirement that is demanded by the organizations. So before deep diving into bunch of Linux commands let's just start with most common question **what and why Linux ?!** . Some says it's an **OS** where as some says it's a **Kernel** . So without a further due let's understand our first question:

## What is and Why Linux?

Linux is an open source Operating System ***based on*** Linux kernel. Open source simply means anyone can contribute to it , can modify it and can even rebrand it. An OS is nothing but an agent that sits between **application** and **hardware**. Linux is used for computers , servers, mainframe , mobile devices and embedded devices. As it supports every major computer architecture such as **x86 , ARM , SPARC** makes it most widely supported OS.

**What is Kernel ?**

Kernel is the main component of any operating system (OS) and is the core interface between a computer’s hardware and its processes. It communicates between the 2, managing resources as efficiently as possible. You find in every mobile phone's about section that says ***based on Linux kernel***. Every Linux-based OS involves the **Linux kernel**—which manages hardware resources—and a set of software packages that make up the rest of the operating system.

As we got to know the definitions above , let's just how can we interact with Linux. There are two ways through which we can make the best out of Linux which are:

**Linux GUI (Graphical User Interface)** : The graphical user interface is that enables an user to interact with the system with a proper look and feel. It is like any other Operating system available in market as Windows or mac.

**Linux CLI (Command Line Interface)** : Where as in Command Line Interface the UI part is completely eliminated. There is no visual representation as windows or mac. The CLI is more efficient , time effective and easy to use only when you have enough knowledge on the Linux commands for performing several operations in the OS.

## CLI from DevOps Prospective

CLI commands enable you to streamline your tasks with faster and flexible interactive canvas, bypassing user interface workflows. Whether it's AWS devops or Azure devops every provider has their CLIs. So , the bottom line is in order to interact with any Linux environment we need to be fluent enough in bunch of Linux commands which we are going to see below .
